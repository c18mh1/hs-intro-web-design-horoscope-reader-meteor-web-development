You'll want to use the `click()` function to capture the user's birthday when they submit the form. From there, `if-statements` will come in handy for generating what horoscope to give your user based on their birthday. You should have the horoscope show up in an alert box once they submit the form.


**BONUS:**

Instead of displaying the text in an alert box, can you display the text inside the `div` with the ID `reading`? Hint, the `append` function should come in handy.
